            <h1>Della Foresta project</h1>
            <p>
                This is a personal project I started in 2018 because of my
                passion for fruits and good food. It always seemed to me 
                that the jams and marmalades you find in the market are too 
                sweet and you cannot enjoy the flavor of the fruit itself.
                Also I couldn't find the flavor of my favourite fruits on them!
                So I decided to do them by myself.
            </p>

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>
                All of it started because one morning there was no maple syrup to put on
                my pancakes. All I could find on the fridge was some pitahayas 
                (or how they call it, dragon fruit). Since I wanted something sweet
                that looked like a nice alternative to syrup it ocurred to me 
                to do some jam with it. And the rest is history...
            </p>

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>
                My family liked it and I started to experiment with some other fruits
                like kiwi, passion fruit, even avocado! But then I started to think 
                in all of the sugar that I put to make it and I knew I had to find an alternative!
            </p>

                People like our product because is innovative and because they have no regrets
                by eating it! Some people even eat it like a pudding (yes, with a spoon, like you see in 
                the picture) because
                it has the right amount of sugar and therefore doesn't have a harsh taste so you
                can enjoy the fruit flavor.
